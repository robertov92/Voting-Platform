# Voting-Platform

Created as a final project for a Backend Development college class.

Create polls easily. Get polls by sharing a link.

This app uses public IP addresses so people can't vote in the same poll multiple times.

You need to run a Redis server to run this code.

Look at the final product: http://3.97.6.204
